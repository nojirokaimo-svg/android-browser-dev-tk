# Titanium Browser for Android

## New-tab clipboard candidate

The empty Android new-tab omnibox restricts zero-prefix suggestions to the
clipboard provider. Android Chromium ordinarily expires that provider's copied
link after three minutes; the new-tab path now accepts an item up to 24 hours
old when Android still retains it. Other pages keep short-lived clipboard
suggestions. Selecting the candidate uses Chromium's existing URL navigation or
text-search handling. On-device behavior needs confirmation with a recently
copied URL and with text after installing the new APK.

## Titanium-Kiwi incremental upstream updates

The `codex/kiwi-ui-port` workflow applies the feature-scoped patches in
`kiwi_port/patches/series.json` to pinned Titanium, Vanadium, and Chromium
commits. The current target is Titanium `v153.0.8010.52`.

Patch-level transitions restore an exact immutable completed `out/Default`
checkpoint, prepare the new pinned source tree, regenerate GN metadata, and let
Ninja rebuild dirty edges across staged jobs. The workflow never runs a clean
build, deletes `out/Default`, overwrites an existing cache key, or falls back to
an older or empty cache. Build #148 performed the upstream transition from the completed Build #146
cache. Its stage-5 compilation ended at the 90-minute budget with about
5,000 of 16,863 Ninja edges complete and saved the exact immutable checkpoint
`kiwi-153-d7d74a667baca929bea9be32749c8a7c301c1333-stage-5`.
The next workflow starts at stage 6 and restores this key literally. It keeps
`.ninja_log`, `.ninja_deps`, object files and generated outputs; stage 7 and
later restore only the preceding checkpoint from that same run. A cache miss
stops before source preparation. The upstream-update workflow separately
requires `incremental_cache_key` and matching
`transition_from_identity`. Do not rerun the upstream transition while
resuming stage 5, and do not substitute a new commit SHA in its restore key.

On Android, returning after a long pause retains the selected tab instead of
creating/selecting an NTP. The NTP itself can still be opened intentionally.
Focusing its empty toolbar URL field shows a recent clipboard link/text
suggestion; typing restores normal search/history suggestions. Selecting the
clipboard row uses Chromium's existing URL navigation or text search handling.

If a transition fails, keep the last completed cache intact, fix the named
feature patch or build configuration, and push a new commit. Regenerate patch
checksums in `series.json`, update matching before/after hashes in
`manifest.json`, then run `python3 kiwi_port/verify_series.py` and the Kiwi port
unit tests before restarting the staged build. Best-effort reapplication names
the conflicting feature and target files while applying independent features.

A secure and fully open-source, Chromium-based web browser with support for extensions, based on [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium) by [GrapheneOS](https://github.com/GrapheneOS). This project was formerly known as [Helium Browser for Android](https://github.com/jqssun/android-helium-browser) but was later renamed to avoid branding confusion. To maintain a fast and native experience for everyone, advanced features are modularized into [**Titanium Extension for Android**](https://github.com/jqssun/android-titanium-extension).

For the latest builds, see [**Releases**](https://github.com/jqssun/android-titanium-browser/releases/latest). You can also update between GitHub and Google Play releases seamlessly.

## Usage

### Installing Extensions

For Chrome extensions, navigate to [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/), enable **Desktop site** using the menu button <kbd>⋮</kbd> in the top right corner, and proceed as normal.

For [Opera Add-ons](https://addons.opera.com/), [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/), or other marketplaces, targeted User Agent modifications may be required. See [**Titanium Extension for Android**](https://github.com/jqssun/android-titanium-extension) for instructions.

You can also load an unpacked extension manually by navigating to the **Manage extensions** page or [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions). Enable **Developer mode**, select **Load unpacked**, and choose the folder containing the extension in the Storage Access Framework (SAF) picker. Manifest V2 (MV2) extensions are supported. It may take a moment for the extension to load.

### Using Extensions

To run an extension in Incognito (OTR) mode, go to **Manage extensions**, find the extension you want to use in Incognito mode, select **Details**, and turn on **Allow in Incognito**.

For advanced features including external download manager support, enhanced dark mode, and additional privacy options, you can use [**Titanium Extension for Android**](https://github.com/jqssun/android-titanium-extension).

### Debug URLs

To view and access the debug URLs, use [`chrome://chrome-urls`](chrome://chrome-urls). For **Experiments**, use [`chrome://flags`](chrome://flags).

### WebRTC IP Policy

The option is available by using the menu button <kbd>⋮</kbd> in the top right corner, then selecting **Settings**, **Privacy and security**. If you experience issues with WebRTC due to IPs being shielded by default (e.g. [Discord Voice](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc)), try changing it to **Default public interface only**, or **Default**.

## Implementation

> [!WARNING]
> [Titanium Browser for Android](#titanium-browser-for-android) only attempts to improve security and privacy where possible. For better protection on Android, you should instead use [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) with [Vanadium](https://vanadium.app), which additionally integrates patches into Android System WebView and provides significant kernel and memory management hardening on the OS level.

## Building

All releases are built using [Actions](https://github.com/jqssun/android-titanium-browser/actions). Current releases can also be attested using [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli).

```shell
gh attestation verify *.apk -R jqssun/android-titanium-browser
```

This repository provides the build script to compile on the latest Ubuntu, and may also work with other Linux distributions.

To build these releases yourself via CI (e.g. GitHub Actions), fork this repository. Supply your `base64` encoded `keystore.jks` and `local.properties` (containing `keyAlias`, `keyPassword` and `storePassword`) to [**Repository secrets**](https://github.com/jqssun/android-titanium-browser/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L49-L50) under **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**. To generate a release, go to **Actions**, select **Build**, and select **Run workflow**. Under **Runner**, you can either use a GitHub-hosted runner by entering `ubuntu-latest`, or `self-hosted` for your own hardware.

## Credits

This project would not have been possible without the huge community contributions from [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium), and without the privacy-focused, open-source approach shared by various other Chromium projects. All credit goes to the original authors and contributors. This project started around the same time as [Helium Browser for Linux](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-linux) but it is not affiliated with the desktop Helium project.
